		<h1>The Legend Of Dale</h1>

		<p>It was a day just like any other, in the life of Garrett. He worked hard at his day job at an awesome Tech Company. Little did he know that this day would change his life forever. That night he went to a small gathering of another team at the company, invited by one of close friends. He was introduced to a manager at the other team, and made a very strong positive impression. Little did he know, that the manager mis-remembered his name as Dale.</p>

		<p>The following day, Garrett's friend was asked how we could recruit Dale to the team. At first the friend was confused. He did not know a "Dale". After much back and forth it was determined that the Dale == Garrett. Still, the name lived on Garrett was known as Dale to many of us.</p>

		<p>The Legend of Dale began to grow throughout the local office until he was known as that. Dale always managed to make it to the office on fried chicken day. It was somehow impressive.</p>

		<p>The secret, we are unable to let Dale's girlfriend discover his name is Dale. Do not call him Dale in front of his girlfriend.</p>
